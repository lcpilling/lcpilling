### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m a genetic epidemiologist researching mechanisms of human health and disease and the University of Exeter Medical School in the UK. Ultimately I want to feed into personalising medicine to improve outcomes in patients.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently particularly interested in:
    - using causal analysis methods in pharmacogenetics to understand treatment effect heterogeneity
    - combining genotype and medical records to understand shared biology in multimorbidity (why some diseases more commonly occur together)

- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate!
