### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m a genetic epidemiologist in the Department of Clinical and Biomedical Science at the University of Exeter in the UK. 

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on:
    - combining genotype and medical records to understand healthy ageing and multimorbidity,
    - using causal analysis methods in pharmacogenetics to understand treatment effect heterogeneity,
    - investigating the role of 'iron overload' (haemochromatosis) on disease burden.

- ğŸ“¦ I like making R packages https://lcpilling.github.io
