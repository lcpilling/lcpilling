### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m a genetic epidemiologist researching mechanisms of human health, disease, and ageing, at the University of Exeter Medical School in the UK. Ultimately I want to inform efforts to "personalize medicine" - to improve outcomes in patients by tailoring treatment, utilizing phenotypic, biomarker, genetic, and health data.

- 🌱 I’m currently particularly interested in:
    - using causal analysis methods in pharmacogenetics to understand treatment effect heterogeneity
    - combining genotype and medical records to understand shared biology in multimorbidity (why some diseases more commonly occur together)
    - investigating the role of 'iron overload' (haemochromatosis) on disease burden

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate!
