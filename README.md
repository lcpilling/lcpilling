### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a genetic epidemiologist researching mechanisms of human health, disease, and ageing. I work in the Department of Clinical and Biomedical Science at the University of Exeter in the UK. I aim to inform efforts to "personalize medicine" - to improve outcomes in patients by better of understand of disease mechanism and tailoring treatment, utilizing phenotypic, biomarker, genetic, and health data.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently particularly interested in:
    - using causal analysis methods in pharmacogenetics to understand treatment effect heterogeneity
    - combining genotype and medical records to understand shared biology in multimorbidity (why some diseases more commonly occur together)
    - investigating the role of 'iron overload' (haemochromatosis) on disease burden

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate!
